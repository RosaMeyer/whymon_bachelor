# WhyMon: explanations as verdicts

**WhyMon** is a runtime monitoring tool that produces explanations as verdicts of metric first-order temporal logic (MFOTL) formulas.

## Getting Started

To execute the project locally, follow the instructions below.

### Prerequisites

**WhyMon** is written in OCaml and requires a recent version of the OCaml compiler
(>= 4.11). We recommend installing OCaml's package manager
[opam](https://opam.ocaml.org/doc/Install.html), which includes OCaml's compiler.

For instance, you can create an OCaml `5.1.0` switch and initialize the environment
variables of your terminal by running

```shell
$ opam switch create 5.1.0
$ eval $(opam config env)
```

To install **WhyMon**'s dependencies, run

```shell
$ opam install dune core_kernel base zarith menhir js_of_ocaml js_of_ocaml-ppx zarith_stubs_js
```

At this point, you are able to locally execute **WhyMon**'s command line
interface (CLI).

However, to locally execute **WhyMon**'s graphical user interface (GUI), you
also need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager) and an
[Ace editor's fork](https://github.com/leonardolima/ace-mfotl) that includes
syntax highlighting for **WhyMon**'s inputs.

Specifically, run

```shell
$ npm install
```

from the `vis` folder to install the GUI's dependencies. Furthermore,
assuming that both `whymon` and `ace-mfotl` are located in the same folder, run

```
$ npm install
$ ./build_copy.sh
```

from the `ace-mfotl` folder.

### Running (CLI)

From **WhyMon**'s root folder, you can compile the code with

```
$ dune build
```

This generates the `bin/whymon.exe` executable. Moreover, running

```
$ ./bin/whymon.exe
```

presents **WhyMon**'s CLI usage statement.

To experiment with **WhyMon**'s CLI interface, you can execute the
`three_attempts` example (introduced in [Lima et al., ATVA'24][4]) that detects unusual authentication
behavior. In particular, the policy `examples/paper-tool/three_attempts.mfotl`
specifies that a single user has attempted to login thrice (in intervals between
1 and 30 seconds) from possibly different countries (based on their IP addresses).
You can run this example with

```
$ ./bin/whymon.exe -sig examples/paper-tool/three_attempts.sig \
                   -formula examples/paper-tool/three_attempts.mfotl \
                   -log examples/paper-tool/three_attempts.log
```

**WhyMon** inputs the MFOTL formula `three_attempts.mfotl`, the trace
`three_attempts.log`, and the signature file `three_attempts.sig` that
specifies the events (and their data parameter types) in the trace.

**WhyMon** outputs explanations in the form of partitioned decision trees
(PDTs) [[Lima et al., TACAS'24]][2].

We distinguish time-points (indices into the trace) and time-stamps,
which are attached to the time-points and denote real time (e.g., a Unix
timestamp).

For instance, in this example, at time-point 0 (with time-stamp 4) the
explanation is the following

```
4:0
Explanation:
❮

c1 ∈ Complement of {NO}

    ❮

    c2 ∈ Complement of {}

        ❮

        c3 ∈ Complement of {}

            ❮

                VExists{0}{u}

                    ❮

                    u ∈ Complement of {}

                        VAndL{0}
                            VPred(0, att, u, c1)
                    ❯


            ❯
        ❯

    ❯


c1 ∈ {NO}

    ❮

    c2 ∈ Complement of {}

        ❮

        c3 ∈ Complement of {}

            ❮

                VExists{0}{u}

                    ❮

                    u ∈ Complement of {6}

                        VAndL{0}
                            VPred(0, att, u, c1)

                    u ∈ {6}

                        VAndR{0}
                            VOnceOut{0}

                    ❯


            ❯
        ❯

    ❯


❯
```

Here, `Complement of {}` corresponds to the infinite domain $\mathbb{D}$. Hence,
`x ∈ Complement of {}` denotes that the variable $x$ can be assigned to any
value of the domain.

For instance, considering the assignment `c1 ∈ {NO}`, `c2 ∈ Complement of {}`,
`c3 ∈ Complement of {}`, the associated proof tree corresponds to a violation
of the existential quantifier for the variable $u$ at time-point 0
(`VExists{0}{u}`). Specifically, there was no user $u$ (such that `u ∈ Complement
of {6}`) that attempted to login from the country NO (Norway) at the current
time-point 0.

You can also run this example with the option `-mode verified`:

```
$ ./bin/whymon.exe -mode verified \
                   -sig examples/paper-tool/three_attempts.sig \
                   -formula examples/paper-tool/three_attempts.mfotl \
                   -log examples/paper-tool/three_attempts.log
```

from **WhyMon**'s root folder. To filter the explanation checker output,
we send **WhyMon**'s CLI output through a pipe (`|`) to **grep**. For instance,

```
$ ./bin/whymon.exe -mode verified \
                   -sig examples/paper-tool/three_attempts.sig \
                   -formula examples/paper-tool/three_attempts.mfotl \
                   -log examples/paper-tool/three_attempts.log | grep "Checker output:"
```

yields

```
Checker output: true
Checker output: true
Checker output: true
Checker output: true
Checker output: true
Checker output: true
```

Indicating the validity of all explanations produced by **WhyMon**'s monitoring algorithm
(one for each of the 6 time-points included in the trace).

For more details on the proof trees and the proof system rules, you can check
[[Lima et al., TACAS'24]][2].

### Running (GUI)

From the `vis` folder, you can start the GUI with

```
$ npm start
```

At this point, a non-deterministic issue regarding a path computation might arise.
To fix this issue, run

```
$ ./tools/fix_path.py
```

from **WhyMon**'s root folder.

Now, you can select, run and interactively explore the included examples using
**WhyMon**'s GUI.

Clicking on the `?` button (in the main page) presents **WhyMon**'s syntax.
In addition, the GUI's usage has been described in the GUI's
[Quickstart](http://localhost:3000/whymon/quickstart) page, [[Lima et al., TACAS'24]][2] and [[Lima et al., ATVA'24]][4].

### Checker

This step requires [Isabelle2024](https://isabelle.in.tum.de/) and depends on the
corresponding [Archive of Formal Proofs (AFP) version](https://www.isa-afp.org/download/).

The file `src/checker.ml` corresponds to the code extracted from
our checker formalized in the proof assistant Isabelle. This formalization has been
published in the AFP [[Herasimau et al., AFP]][3]. Alternatively, you can extract this code
from the current repository on your local machine by running

```
$ isabelle build -vd thys -eD code
```

from inside the `formalization` folder. This generates the file
`formalization/code/checker.ocaml`, which is identical to the already included file
`src/checker.ml`.
